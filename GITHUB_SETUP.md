# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `Payroll-System-FWC`
3. Description: "Modern Payroll Management System built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS"
4. Choose Public or Private
5. **DO NOT** check "Add a README file", "Add .gitignore", or "Choose a license" (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect and Push

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\mauma\Desktop\Payroll System FWC"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Payroll-System-FWC.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Alternative: If you want me to do it

Just provide me with your GitHub repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername/Payroll-System-FWC.git`) and I'll run the commands for you!
